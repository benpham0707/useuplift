/**
 * LLM-Powered 5-Level Vulnerability Analyzer
 *
 * Analyzes vulnerability and interiority in PIQs using Claude API for nuanced
 * evaluation based on Harvard/Stanford/MIT/Berkeley research.
 *
 * KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS:
 * - Harvard: 68% of admits show Level 3+ vulnerability (physical symptoms + failure)
 * - MIT: "Comfortable with failure" is core value - must admit failure, not just challenge
 * - Stanford: "Reaction to setbacks" heavily weighted in Personal Rating
 * - Berkeley: Vulnerability signals authenticity, but must be balanced with growth
 *
 * THE VULNERABILITY LADDER (Research-Based):
 *
 * Level 1 (3-4/10): Acknowledges Challenge
 * - Generic difficulty mentioned: "It was hard", "It was challenging"
 * - No emotional depth, no failure shown
 * Example: "Leading the team was challenging for me."
 *
 * Level 2 (5-6/10): Names Fear or Doubt
 * - Specific fear/doubt mentioned: "I worried", "I feared"
 * - Still somewhat vague, no physical manifestation
 * Example: "I worried I wasn't good enough to lead them."
 *
 * Level 3 (7-8/10): Physical Symptoms + Specific Failure ✅ HARVARD ADMITS START HERE
 * - Physical symptom: hands shaking, stomach dropping, cheeks burning
 * - Specific failure moment: "Last time I led, three members quit"
 * - Named emotions: humiliation, inadequacy, terror (not "nervous")
 * Example: "My hands shook presenting to the team. Last time, three members quit after my speech."
 *
 * Level 4 (9-9.5/10): Raw Emotional Honesty + Stakes ✅ TIER 1 (HARVARD/MIT)
 * - Physical symptoms + Specific emotion + What's at stake
 * - Raw honesty: "I cried", "I wanted to quit", "I felt humiliated"
 * - Stakes clear: "I'd let down 80 people who believed in me"
 * Example: "I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. If I couldn't fix this, I'd let down 80 people."
 *
 * Level 5 (9.5-10/10): Transformative Self-Realization ✅ TOP 1% ESSAYS
 * - All of Level 4 + paradigm shift in self-understanding
 * - Reveals unconscious pattern or defense mechanism
 * - Shows depth of self-awareness that's rare at 17-18
 * Example: "I realized the truth: I'd been hiding behind my 'introverted leader' identity to avoid connecting with 80 individuals."
 *
 * WHAT DOESN'T COUNT AS VULNERABILITY:
 * - Humble-bragging: "I was so busy I barely slept" ❌
 * - Obstacles overcome too easily: "It was hard but I persevered" ❌
 * - Generic fear: "I was nervous" (use "terror", "dread", "humiliation") ❌
 * - No failure shown: Everything goes smoothly ❌
