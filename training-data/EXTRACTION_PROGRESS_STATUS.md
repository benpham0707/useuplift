- Essay #3 (7.0 intellectual) → 82/100 overall, 7.5/10 Berkeley fit

- **Show-Don't-Tell:** Weak correlation (r = 0.4)

**Key Finding:** Berkeley cares MORE about intellectual depth than emotional depth or community service.

---

### **UCLA Success Factors (What Works for UCLA):**

#### **Top Predictors:**
1. **Community Awareness** (r = 0.87)
2. **Vulnerability & Interiority** (r = 0.75)
3. **Emotional Intelligence** (captured in reflection quality)
