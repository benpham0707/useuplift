## 🎯 New Score Scale (0-110)

### **Score Ranges & School Placement Potential**

| Score Range | Competitiveness Level | School Placement Potential* | Meaning |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------|
| **100-110** | Elite Competitive | HYPSM (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT) + Columbia, Caltech, UChicago | Demonstrates exceptional achievement. Strong potential for most selective schools. |
| **90-99** | Highly Competitive | Top UCs (Berkeley, UCLA), Northwestern, Duke, Cornell, USC, CMU | Excellent profile. Competitive for top-tier schools. HYPSM possible with strong overall app. |
| **80-89** | Very Competitive | Mid-tier UCs (UCSD, UCSB, UCI), Michigan, UNC, UT Austin, NYU | Strong foundation. Solid for competitive state schools and top privates. |
| **70-79** | Competitive | UC Davis, UC Irvine, Boston University, Wisconsin, UIUC | Good profile component. Competitive for strong public universities. |
| **60-69** | Developing | UC Riverside, UC Merced, state schools | Shows potential. Continue building depth and achievement. |
| **<60** | Needs Growth | -- | This component needs significant strengthening. Focus on adding measurable impact and depth. |

**Important Disclaimer (shown with all scores):**
> \*School placement potential is an estimate based on this PIQ component alone. Actual admissions depend on your entire application: GPA, test scores, all essays, letters of recommendation, and holistic review. These ranges show where students with similar profiles on this dimension have been competitive, but outcomes vary widely.

## 🔄 Migration from 100-point to 110-point Scale

### **Simple Formula:**
```
New Score (110 scale) = Old Score (100 scale) + 10
```

### **Examples:**

| Old Profile | Old Score (100) | New Score (110) | New Band |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| First-gen + family + 9 APs + 3.85 | 64 | **74** | Competitive (UC Davis, BU level) |
| First-gen + family + 10 APs + 3.9 | 70 | **80** | Very Competitive (UCSD, Michigan level) |
| Student Council President + metrics | 63 | **73** | Competitive |
| State debate champion | 95 | **105** | Elite Competitive (HYPSM potential) |
| First-gen only + 8 APs + 3.7 | 54 | **64** | Developing |
