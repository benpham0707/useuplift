# SCORING AUDIT: Grade Inflation Issues

## Critical Problems with Current Scoring

### **Issue #1: Scores Too High (Grade Inflation)**

**Current Reality:**
- PIQ 4 can reach 98/100 for first-gen + family duties + financial need + 9 AP courses
- PIQ 1 starts at 75/100 base just for having leadership
- PIQ 6 reaches 93/100 easily with intended major + AP courses
- Students with good-but-not-exceptional profiles getting 90+ scores

**HYPSM Reality:**
- MIT acceptance rate: 3.9%
- Stanford: 3.7%
- Harvard: 3.4%
- Princeton: 5.7%
- Columbia: 3.9%

A score of 90+/100 should mean **"competitive for HYPSM"** - meaning top 3-5% of ALL applicants nationwide, not just "good student with challenges."

---

### **Issue #2: Bonuses Stack Too Generously**

**Example: PIQ 4 (Educational Barrier)**

Current bonuses:
```
Base: 40
+ First-gen: +25
+ Family duties (15 hrs/week): +20
+ Challenging circumstances: +20
+ Financial need: +15
+ 9 AP courses: +18
= 138 points → capped at 98
```

**Problem:** These bonuses add up to 98 points for circumstances that, while meaningful, are **common among competitive applicants**.

**HYPSM Reality:**
- 15-20% of admits are first-gen
- Many admits work 20+ hrs/week while taking 12+ APs with 4.0 unweighted
- **Context matters but doesn't replace exceptional achievement**

---

### **Issue #3: Base Scores Too High**

Current base scores:
- PIQ 1 (Leadership): 75/100 base just for having substantive leadership
- PIQ 2 (Creative): 70/100 base for any creative talent
- PIQ 3 (Talent): 70/100 base for 10+ hrs/week commitment
- PIQ 4 (Barrier): 40/100 base (this one is actually reasonable)

**Problem:** A 70-75 base score should mean **"strong foundation for a compelling essay"** but doesn't account for the quality/impact of the activity itself.

**HYPSM Reality:**
- "Student Council President" ≠ "Founded nonprofit serving 1000+ students"
- "Debate Team Captain" ≠ "National champion debater"
- "10 hrs/week piano" ≠ "Carnegie Hall performance"

The **base score should reflect achievement level**, not just category.

---

### **Issue #4: Bonuses for Common Achievements**

Current bonuses that are too generous:

**PIQ 1 (Leadership):**
- +10 for 3+ leadership roles (breadth is good but not rare)
- +10 for 100+ characters of impact description (just means they wrote more)
- +5 for 10+ hrs/week (this is baseline for real leadership)

**PIQ 4 (Educational Barrier):**
- +25 for first-gen (meaningful but common at top schools)
- +18 for taking AP courses (this should be **expected** at HYPSM level)
- +20 for "challenging circumstances" (too vague)

**PIQ 6 (Academic Passion):**
- +15 for having an intended major + AP courses (baseline expectation)
- +8 for AP scores 4+ (4s aren't impressive for HYPSM, need 5s)

---

### **Issue #5: Missing Penalty for Weak Activities**

Current system gives points for:
- Any leadership role (even title-only if it has "impact")
- Any creative activity
- Any 10+ hrs/week commitment

**HYPSM Reality:**
- **Impact quality matters more than quantity**
- Generic/common activities should score LOWER than unique/distinctive ones
- Title-only leadership should be heavily penalized

---

## What HYPSM Actually Looks For

Based on actual admitted student profiles:

### **Leadership (PIQ 1)**
**90+/100:** Founded organization with 500+ beneficiaries, or state/national-level elected position with measurable impact
**80-89:** Regional leadership with documented systemic change, or captain of nationally competitive team
**70-79:** School-wide leadership with measurable impact (not just managing a club)
**60-69:** Substantive leadership role with local impact
**<60:** Title-only or minimal documented impact

### **Educational Barrier (PIQ 4)**
**90+/100:** Exceptional achievement despite severe barriers (e.g., homeless + 15 APs + 4.0 + research)
**80-89:** Significant achievement despite major barriers (e.g., first-gen + family duties + 10+ APs + strong GPA)
**70-79:** Good achievement despite moderate barriers (e.g., first-gen + 8 APs + 3.7+ GPA)
**60-69:** Barriers present but achievement is baseline for UC/competitive colleges
**<60:** Context without corresponding achievement

### **Academic Passion (PIQ 6)**
**90+/100:** Published research, Intel/Regeneron finalist, or college-level coursework with distinction
**80-89:** Significant research project, competitive science olympiad, or deep independent study
**70-79:** Strong course rigor + related EC with depth (e.g., 12+ APs + research lab 15+ hrs/week)
**60-69:** Intended major + appropriate course rigor
**<60:** Generic interest without depth

## Proposed Strict Scoring System

### **New Scoring Philosophy**

1. **Base scores start LOWER** (30-50 range for most)
2. **Bonuses are EARNED** through exceptional achievement, not just participation
3. **Context bonuses are CAPPED** (max +30 from all context combined)
4. **Achievement bonuses DOMINATE** (should be +40-50 for truly exceptional work)
5. **90+ scores are RARE** (top 3-5% of applicants only)

### **Score Distribution Target**

For a pool of 1000 competitive UC applicants:
- **90-100:** Top 3-5% (30-50 students) - HYPSM competitive
- **80-89:** Top 10-15% (100-150 students) - Strong for UCLA/Berkeley
- **70-79:** Top 25-30% (250-300 students) - Solid UC profile
- **60-69:** Top 50% (500 students) - Competitive for mid-tier UCs
- **<60:** Lower 50% - Needs significant strengthening

### **Strict Bonus Criteria**

**Context Bonuses (MAX +30 total from all sources):**
- First-gen: +8 (not +25)
- Family responsibilities 15+ hrs/week: +8 (not +20)
- Financial need (working 15+ hrs/week): +8 (not +15)
- Challenging circumstances (specific, documented): +6 (not +20)

**Achievement Bonuses (NO CAP, can go to +50+):**
- National/international recognition: +30-40
- State/regional recognition: +20-25
- Published research/creative work: +15-25
- Founded organization serving 100+ people: +15-20
- Measurable, documented impact: +10-15

---

## Next Steps

1. **Redesign all 8 PIQ scoring algorithms** with strict criteria
2. **Implement achievement tiers** (local → regional → state → national)
3. **Cap context bonuses** at +30 total
4. **Raise bar for 90+ scores** significantly
5. **Test against real HYPSM admitted profiles**
6. **Verify score distribution** matches actual competitiveness

---

## Key Principle

**"Good" should not score 90/100. "Exceptional" should score 90/100.**

- First-gen + family duties + 9 APs + 3.85 GPA = **Good story, score: 72-78**
- First-gen + working 25 hrs/week + 12 APs all 5s + 4.0 + research = **Exceptional, score: 85-90**
- First-gen + homeless + 15 APs all 5s + published research + nonprofit founder = **Transcendent, score: 95+**

The current system conflates "good" with "exceptional."
