# HYPSM Strict Scoring Rubric

**Philosophy:** Scores should reflect competitiveness for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Columbia, and equivalent top-tier institutions. A 90+ score means "this essay/profile component is competitive for HYPSM." Anything less means there's room for improvement.

---

## Universal Scoring Principles

### **Score Ranges**

| Range | Meaning | HYPSM Competitiveness |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **95-100** | Transcendent | Top 1% nationally - exceptional even among HYPSM admits |
| **90-94** | Exceptional | Top 3-5% - solidly competitive for HYPSM |
| **85-89** | Outstanding | Top 10% - competitive for HYPSM with strong rest of app |
| **80-84** | Strong | Top 15-20% - competitive for top UCs, reach for HYPSM |
| **75-79** | Above Average | Top 25-30% - solid for UCs, unlikely for HYPSM |
| **70-74** | Good | Top 35-40% - competitive for mid-tier UCs |
| **60-69** | Adequate | Top 50% - shows potential but needs development |
| **50-59** | Developing | Lower 50% - significant improvement needed |
| **<50** | Weak | Not competitive for selective schools |

### **Context vs Achievement Bonuses**

**Context Bonuses (MAX +30 total):**
- These recognize barriers overcome
- **Capped** because context alone doesn't guarantee admission
- HYPSM wants **achievement despite barriers**, not just barriers

**Achievement Bonuses (NO CAP):**
- These recognize exceptional accomplishment
- Can exceed +50 for truly extraordinary work
- **This is what separates HYPSM admits from strong UC admits**

## PIQ 1: Leadership Experience

### **Base Score Calculation**

| Leadership Level | Base Score | Criteria |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **Transformative** | 50 | Founded organization serving 500+ OR state/national elected position with documented systemic impact |
| **Impactful** | 40 | Regional leadership with measurable change OR captain of nationally ranked team (top 25) |
| **Substantive** | 30 | School-wide leadership with documented impact (not just managing meetings) |
| **Positional** | 20 | Leadership role with some documentation but limited measurable impact |
| **Title-only** | 10 | Leadership title but minimal evidence of actual leadership actions |

### **Achievement Bonuses (Unlimited)**

| Achievement | Points | Criteria |
|------------|--------|----------|
| National/International recognition | +30-40 | National leadership award, international competition win, national media coverage |
| State/Regional impact | +20-25 | State-level competition placement, regional systemic change affecting 1000+ |
| Founded impactful organization | +15-25 | Created organization still operating, serving 100+ people, sustainable model |
| Documented transformation | +15-20 | Measurable before/after metrics (e.g., "increased participation 300%", "raised $50K") |
| Breadth of leadership | +8-12 | 3+ substantive (not title-only) leadership roles showing versatility |
| Deep time commitment | +5-8 | 15+ hrs/week for 2+ years (not 10 hrs for 1 year) |

### **Context Bonuses (MAX +30 total from ALL sources)**

| Context | Points | Criteria |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Led despite barriers | +10-15 | First-gen/low-income leading in under-resourced school OR immigrant leading language/cultural programs |
| Self-initiated | +8-10 | Created role/organization from scratch (not just elected to existing position) |
| Overcame opposition | +5-8 | Documented resistance overcome (e.g., admin opposition, funding challenges) |

### **Score Examples**

**Score 95:** Founded nonprofit teaching coding to 1000+ underserved students across 5 schools, raised $75K, organization sustainable after graduation, featured in local news + Congressional recognition. (Base: 50 + Founded: +25 + Transformation: +20 = 95)

**Score 88:** State debate champion, led team to nationals (top 10), mentored 20+ students, created new curriculum adopted by 3 schools. (Base: 40 + State: +23 + Transformation: +15 + Breadth: +10 = 88)

**Score 75:** Student Council President, organized 5 school-wide events, managed $10K budget, improved student feedback scores by 25%. (Base: 30 + Transformation: +15 + Time: +5 = 50... wait this is too low)

Let me recalibrate...

**Score 75:** Student Council President with measurable impact - organized 5 events serving 1200 students, improved satisfaction 40%, led 25-person team. (Base: 30 + Documented: +18 + Breadth: +10 + Time: +7 = 65... still needs +10 context/achievement to hit 75)

**Score 62:** Debate Captain, led team to regional competition, 12 hrs/week, team improved from last place to 3rd in league. (Base: 30 + Regional: +15 + Transformation: +10 + Time: +7 = 62)

**Score 48:** Club President, organized weekly meetings, managed 15 members, no documented measurable outcomes. (Base: 20 + Breadth: +8 + Time: +5 = 33... wait)

Actually, let me recalibrate the base scores...

## PIQ 4: Educational Opportunity or Barrier

### **Base Score Calculation (Achievement Component)**

| Achievement Level | Base Score | Criteria |
|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Transcendent** | 50 | 12+ APs (all 5s) + 4.0 UW + research/publication OR equivalent exceptional achievement despite barriers |
| **Exceptional** | 40 | 10+ APs (mostly 5s) + 3.9+ GPA + significant EC achievement despite barriers |
| **Strong** | 30 | 8+ APs + 3.7+ GPA + good ECs despite barriers |
| **Good** | 20 | 6+ APs/Honors + 3.5+ GPA despite barriers |
| **Adequate** | 10 | Some rigor pursued despite barriers |

### **Context Bonuses (MAX +30 total from ALL sources)**

| Context Factor | Points | Criteria |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Severe barriers | +15 | Homelessness, severe poverty (free lunch + working 20+ hrs/week), refugee status, serious illness |
| Major barriers | +10 | First-gen + family caregiver 15+ hrs/week, undocumented status, single-parent household + working |
| Moderate barriers | +8 | First-gen alone, OR family responsibilities 10+ hrs/week, OR financial need (working 10+ hrs/week) |
| Language barriers | +5 | English learner (arrived in US within 5 years) |
| School resource limitations | +5 | Under-resourced school (limited AP access, documented lack of counseling) |

**IMPORTANT:** Context bonuses **stack up to max +30**. So first-gen (+8) + family 15 hrs/week (+10 major barrier includes first-gen, so total +10) + financial need if also working would be +10 total, not +8+10+8.

Actually, let me clarify the stacking:

**Barrier Severity Tiers (CHOOSE HIGHEST, don't stack):**
- Tier 1 (Severe): +15 (homelessness, refugee, extreme poverty with 20+ hrs work/family)
- Tier 2 (Major): +10 (first-gen + family caregiver 15+ hrs OR undocumented + working)
- Tier 3 (Moderate): +8 (first-gen alone OR family 10-14 hrs OR working 10+ hrs)
- Tier 4 (Minor): +5 (single minor barrier)

**Additional Stackable Context (MAX +15 additional):**
- English learner: +5
- Under-resourced school: +5
- Multiple barrier types: +5 (if barriers span family + financial + language, not just one type)

**Max context total: +15 (tier) + +15 (additional) = +30**

### **Achievement Bonuses (Unlimited)**

| Achievement | Points | Criteria |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Research/Publication | +25-35 | Published research, Intel/Regeneron finalist, significant independent research |
| Exceptional rigor | +15-25 | 12+ APs all 5s + college courses + self-studied additional APs |
| Founded opportunity | +15-20 | Created program/organization to help others facing similar barriers (100+ beneficiaries) |
| Perfect academics despite barriers | +12-18 | 4.0 UW GPA + top SAT/ACT despite severe barriers |
| Advocacy/Leadership | +10-15 | Led initiative to create opportunities for others (new program at school, policy change) |

### **Score Examples**

**Score 96:** Homeless for 2 years, worked 25 hrs/week, 13 APs (twelve 5s, one 4), 4.0 GPA, founded nonprofit helping homeless students access education (serving 200+), published research on educational equity. (Base: 50 + Context tier 1: +15 + Multiple barriers: +5 + English learner: +5 = +25 context, BUT also +20 founded nonprofit + +18 perfect academics + +28 research = Base 50 + context 25 capped at +30 + achievement +66... wait this exceeds 100)

Let me reconsider the formula:
- Base score = achievement level ALONE (no barriers)
- Context adjustment = how much harder it was to achieve that due to barriers (MAX +30)
- Final = min(base + context, 100)

So for the homeless student:
- **Base: 50** (12+ APs all 5s + 4.0 + research would be exceptional even WITHOUT barriers)
- **Context: +30** (Tier 1 severe +15, multiple types +5, founded to help others +10 = +30 capped)
- **Final: 80**

Wait, this still seems low for someone who did all that while homeless. Let me reconsider...

Actually, the base score should INCLUDE the research/nonprofit founding. So:

**Recalibrated Base Scores for PIQ 4:**
- Base 50: 12+ APs all 5s + 4.0 + published research/Intel/founded impactful org
- Base 40: 10+ APs mostly 5s + 3.9+ + significant achievement (research project, regional recognition)
- Base 30: 8+ APs + 3.7+ + good ECs
- Base 20: 6+ APs/Honors + 3.5+
- Base 10: Some rigor

So homeless student with 13 APs + 4.0 + research + nonprofit:
- **Base: 50** (would be top-tier even without barriers)
- **Context: +30** (homeless tier 1 severe +15, working 25 hrs +10 included in severe, founded to help others facing same barrier +10, multiple barrier types +5 = +30 capped)
- **Final: 80**

Hmm, 80 still seems low for this profile. Let me check if I'm thinking about this right...

**Actually, I think the issue is:** For PIQ 4 specifically, the context IS the story. So maybe PIQ 4 needs different logic:

### **PIQ 4 Revised Formula:**

Score = (Barrier Severity × Achievement Multiplier)

**Barrier Severity:**
- Severe (homelessness, refugee, extreme poverty): 70 base
- Major (first-gen + caregiver/work, undocumented): 55 base
- Moderate (first-gen alone, OR caregiver OR work): 45 base
- Minor (single small barrier): 35 base

**Achievement Multiplier:**
- Transcendent achievement (research/publication/4.0+12APs): ×1.40 = +28 points
- Exceptional (10+ APs 3.9+): ×1.30 = +16-20 points
- Strong (8+ APs 3.7+): ×1.15 = +7-8 points
- Good (6+ APs 3.5+): ×1.05 = +2-3 points

So homeless student: 70 (severe) × 1.40 = 98 ✓

First-gen + family 15 hrs + 9 APs + 3.85 GPA:
- Major barrier: 55
- × 1.15 (strong achievement): 55 × 1.15 = 63.25 ≈ **63**

First-gen alone + 8 APs + 3.7:
- Moderate: 45
- × 1.15: 45 × 1.15 = 51.75 ≈ **52**

This feels more reasonable!

Let me continue with the other PIQs using similar strict logic...

## PIQ 6: Academic Subject/Passion

### **Base Score (Interest + Course Rigor)**

| Level | Base Score | Criteria |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Exceptional** | 45 | 12+ APs in subject area + college coursework + self-study |
| **Strong** | 35 | 8+ APs including subject-related + strong performance (mostly 5s) |
| **Good** | 25 | 6+ APs + intended major alignment |
| **Adequate** | 15 | Some AP rigor + interest declared |

### **Achievement Bonuses (Unlimited)**

| Achievement | Points | Criteria |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Published research | +30-40 | Peer-reviewed publication or Intel/Regeneron/Siemens finalist |
| Significant research | +20-28 | Multi-year research project with mentor, conference presentation |
| Competition success | +15-25 | USAMO/USACO/USAPhO medalist, national science olympiad top 10 |
| Teaching/Leadership | +10-15 | Founded tutoring org (100+ students), created curriculum, taught college-prep course |
| Independent study | +8-12 | Self-studied college-level material, completed online courses with distinction |
| Related EC depth | +5-10 | 15+ hrs/week for 2+ years in subject-related activity (lab, math circle, coding) |

### **Context Bonuses (MAX +15 for PIQ 6 specifically)**

| Context | Points | Criteria |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Self-taught despite barriers | +10 | Taught themselves advanced material without school resources/tutors |
| Created opportunity | +8 | Started program/club at under-resourced school to pursue passion |
| Overcame school limitations | +5 | School offered <5 APs, self-studied to pursue passion |

### **Score Examples**

**Score 94:** Published research in peer-reviewed journal, USAMO qualifier, 12 APs in math/science (all 5s), founded math tutoring org serving 200+ students. (Base: 45 + Research: +35 + Competition: +15 + Teaching: +12 = 107 → capped at 94 to leave room for truly exceptional)

Wait, if we can go above 100 with bonuses, maybe cap at 100 total but allow bonuses to push there?

**Revised: Final score = min(base + all bonuses, 100)**

**Score 94:** (Base: 45 + Research: +35 + USAMO: +18 + Tutoring: +12 = 110 → capped at 100... but we want 94)

I think the issue is I'm giving too many points again. Let me recalibrate bonuses to be stricter:

**Achievement Bonuses (Stricter):**
- Published research: +25-30
- Significant research: +15-20
- National competition top 10: +15-20
- Competition qualification (USAMO/etc): +8-12
- Teaching/Founded org: +8-12
- Independent study: +5-8
- EC depth: +3-6

**Score 94:** Published research + USAMO + tutoring org + 12 APs: Base 45 + Research +28 + USAMO +10 + Tutoring +11 = 94 ✓

**Score 78:** Significant research project + 10 APs + founded small tutoring program: Base 35 + Research +18 + Teaching +8 + ECs +5 = 66... need +12 more

Actually maybe base scores should be higher if they already have significant achievement:

**Recalibrated Base Scores for PIQ 6:**
- Base 50: 12+ APs + research OR national competition
- Base 40: 10+ APs + significant subject-related achievement
- Base 30: 8+ APs + subject alignment
- Base 20: 6+ APs + interest

**Score 78:** 10 APs + research project + tutoring: Base 40 + Research +18 + Teaching +8 + Depth +5 = 71... still need +7

Maybe I need to bump achievement bonuses slightly OR accept that 78 requires pretty exceptional work:

**Score 78:** 10 APs in subject + research presented at conference + founded tutoring org serving 50+ for 2 years + independent college coursework: Base 40 + Research +20 + Teaching +10 + Independent +8 = 78 ✓

That feels right - a 78 requires solid research + leadership + depth, not just taking APs.

I think I have the pattern now. Let me create the complete strict rubric for all 8 PIQs...
