## Test 1: Over Limit (365) - Requesting Additions

**Word Count**: 365/350 ⚠️ OVER LIMIT

**Student Question**:
> I want to add more specific details about the school board presentation. What should I add?

**AI Coach Response**:
Okay, so you're at 365 words—15 over the limit. Before we add those board presentation details, we need to make room.

Here's what's not earning its place:

"I have always been incredibly passionate about making a real difference in my community through volunteer work and leadership opportunities" (19 words) → This is setup. Your actions already show your passion. Cut it entirely.

"which was a great victory" (5 words) → Delete. We can see it's a victory from the 47% reduction that follows.

"that I will carry forward into my future endeavors at college and beyond" (13 words) → Generic ending. Cut it.

Cut these → you're at 328 words. NOW you have room for about 20 words of board presentation detail.

For the presentation scene, I want the moment right before you spoke. Something like: "I gripped my note cards, watching the board members shuffle papers while I waited for my turn." That physical detail—the note cards, your hands—grounds us in the actual moment.

Your formal voice works here: "My voice shook with nervousness, but I pushed through with determination"—that's already good. Just add the before moment, the physical setup that shows your nerves were real.

Want to try that trade-off—cut those generic phrases, add the pre-presentation moment?

## Test 2: Over Limit (365) - General Improvement

**Word Count**: 365/350 ⚠️ OVER LIMIT

**Student Question**:
> How can I make this stronger?

**AI Coach Response**:
Okay, so first—you're at 365 words, which is 15 over the limit. Before we strengthen anything, we need to make room.

Here's what I'm seeing: You've got a solid story arc, but there's some throat-clearing that's not earning its place. Look at your opening: "I have always been incredibly passionate about making a real difference in my community through volunteer work and leadership opportunities" (18 words)—this is generic setup. We already know you care because you founded a club.

Quick cuts to get you under 350:
- Delete that entire opening sentence (-18 words)
- "which was a great victory" (-5 words) → The approval itself shows victory
- "This experience taught me valuable lessons about" (-7 words) → Just state the insight directly

That's -30 words, putting you at 335. Perfect.

Now, here's what could make this stronger: "My voice shook with nervousness, but I pushed through with determination"—this is your most human moment, but it's buried in the middle. What if you opened there? Right in that board room, voice shaking, about to present?

You write with this measured, formal rhythm—"crafted a comprehensive proposal," "channeling collective passion"—that's your voice. Don't change it. But starting with vulnerability instead of mission statements? That's what transforms good essays into memorable ones.

Want to try moving that board room moment to your opening?

## Test 3: Near Limit (342) - Requesting Dialogue

**Word Count**: 342/350 ⚠️ NEAR LIMIT

**Student Question**:
> Should I add dialogue to make this more engaging?

**AI Coach Response**:
You're at 342 words—just 8 away from the limit. Adding dialogue would cost 15-20 words, so we'd need to make room first.

But here's the thing: I actually don't think you need dialogue here. Your voice is formal and measured—that's your strength. "My voice shook, but I pushed through" already gives us that vulnerable moment without needing to manufacture conversation.

What you DO need is more specificity in your impact section. Right now "channeling collective passion into measurable change" sounds like a LinkedIn post. Your voice works better with concrete details.

Here's the trade-off I'd make:
→ CUT: "I have always been incredibly passionate about making a real difference" (11 words of generic setup)
→ ADD: "Three years later, those refill stations prevent 1,800 bottles weekly" (10 words of specific ongoing impact)

This keeps your formal tone but grounds your conclusion in real numbers—which matches how you opened with "2,000 plastic bottles weekly." The parallel structure strengthens your whole essay.

The dialogue idea comes from good instincts about engagement, but your essay is already engaging through data and vulnerability. Don't force a voice that isn't yours.

Should we make that trade, or is there another part that's bugging you?

## Test 4: Near Limit (342) - Specific Addition

**Word Count**: 342/350 ⚠️ NEAR LIMIT

**Student Question**:
> I want to add a specific moment showing my voice shaking. Will that fit?

**AI Coach Response**:
Okay, so you're at 342 words—just 8 words from the limit. Adding a specific "voice shaking" moment would cost about 15-20 words, putting you over.

But here's the thing: you already HAVE that moment. "My voice shook, but I pushed through" is perfect. It's vulnerable without being dramatic, and it fits your measured, earnest voice. Don't mess with it.

If you want more space to expand elsewhere, let's make a strategic cut. Looking at your opening: "I have always been incredibly passionate about making a real difference" (11 words)—this is generic setup that your actions already prove. Cut it entirely.

Your real opening: "During my junior year, I founded the Environmental Action Club at my school with just three members." That's your hook. It's direct, specific, and immediately shows leadership in action.

Cut that first sentence → you're at 331 words → now you have 19 words to work with if you want to add detail elsewhere.

But honestly? Your essay is strong at 75 points. The "voice shook" line already does the work you want it to do. Sometimes the best revision is knowing when to stop.

Want to make that cut and call it done, or is there another moment you're thinking about expanding?

## Test 5: Plenty of Room (280) - Requesting Additions

**Word Count**: 280/350 ✅ ROOM AVAILABLE

**Student Question**:
> This feels too short. What should I add?

**AI Coach Response**:
Okay, so I just read this and here's what jumped out at me: You've got the skeleton of a really solid story, but you're telling it like a progress report instead of showing us what actually happened.

"I researched plastic pollution data and presented to the school board"—this is where your essay should LIVE. What did that presentation look like? Were you nervous? Did someone challenge your numbers? What exactly did you say that made them approve funding?

And "Our beach cleanups attracted only a handful of students at first"—I want to see that first cleanup. Three people standing on a beach with trash bags, maybe wondering if this was a terrible idea. That's your opening right there.

You've got 70 words to play with, which is perfect room to add one specific scene. Pick either the school board moment or that first beach cleanup and drop us into it. Show us the "before" picture—the moment when success wasn't guaranteed.

Your formal voice works great for this topic—you don't need to get casual or dramatic. Just trade some of the summary ("We reduced plastic waste by 47%") for the story of HOW you got there.

Which moment feels more vivid to you—facing the school board or that first cleanup with three people?

## Test 6: Plenty of Room (280) - Specific Expansion

**Word Count**: 280/350 ✅ ROOM AVAILABLE

**Student Question**:
> Can I add more about how I presented to the board?

**AI Coach Response**:
Okay, so you're at 280 words with 70 words of wiggle room—perfect for expanding that board presentation moment. And yes, absolutely add more there. Right now "I researched plastic pollution data and presented to the school board" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in just 12 words.

Here's what I'm seeing: You've got this measured, methodical voice—"I founded," "I researched," "I learned"—which works for you. Don't mess with that rhythm. But that board presentation? That's your pivotal moment. That's where a high schooler walked into a room full of adults and made something happen.

What I want to see: The 30 seconds before you started talking. Were you standing at a podium? Did you have slides? What was the first thing you said? Something like: "I stood at the podium with my laptop showing our campus waste audit—2,847 plastic bottles in one week. 'We can cut this in half,' I told the board."

That's about 30 words and gives us the setup, the data (specific!), and your direct quote to them. It shows leadership through action, not just telling us you presented.

Your current structure is solid—problem, research, action, results. We're just adding muscle to the action part where you actually influenced those adults to say yes.

Want to draft that moment, or should we talk through what actually happened in that room first?
