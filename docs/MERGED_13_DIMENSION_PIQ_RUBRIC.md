# MERGED 13-DIMENSION PIQ RUBRIC
**Unified System: Best of Existing 9-Dimension PIQ + 13-Dimension Extracurricular Workshop**

Generated: 2025-11-16
Status: Design Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Combine:
- **PIQ-specific dimensions** (Opening Hook, Vulnerability, Identity) from existing system
- **Proven extracurricular dimensions** (Leadership, Community, Context) from 19-iteration workshop
- **Shared dimensions** (Voice, Specificity, Arc, Reflection, Craft) refined from both

Result: **13 comprehensive dimensions** that work for ALL 8 UC PIQ prompts with flexible weights per prompt type.

## THE 13 DIMENSIONS

### Tier 1: Critical Foundations (45% total weight baseline)

#### 1. Opening Hook Quality (10%)
**From**: Existing PIQ system (was 15%)
**What it measures**: How effectively your opening grabs attention, establishes stakes, and promises a compelling story
**Why PIQ-specific**: PIQs are 350 words - you have 3-5 seconds to hook the reader
**Key criteria**:
- Hook type sophistication (in medias res, vulnerability-first, sensory immersion)
- Immediate engagement and intrigue
- Stakes establishment (why should reader care)
- Connection to essay body
- Literary techniques used

**Prompt-specific weights**:
- PIQ 2 (Creative): 12% (higher - artistic openings matter)
- PIQ 5 (Challenge): 11% (higher - dramatic stakes)
- PIQ 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8: 9-10%

---

#### 2. Vulnerability & Authenticity (12%)
**From**: Existing PIQ system (was 20%)
**What it measures**: Emotional depth, risk-taking, transformation credibility, and authentic self-revelation
**Why PIQ-specific**: 68% of successful admits show high vulnerability; UC values "personal insight"
**Key criteria**:
- Level of vulnerability (1-5 scale: surface → raw)
- Physical/sensory symptoms of emotion (hands shaking, threw up, couldn't sleep)
- Specific failures and how you handled them
- Transformation credibility (earned vs imposed growth)
- Defense mechanisms and self-awareness
- Authenticity markers vs manufactured phrases

**Prompt-specific weights**:
- PIQ 5 (Challenge): 15% (highest - emotional honesty critical)
- PIQ 4 (Educational Barrier): 13%
- PIQ 8 (Open-Ended): 12%
- PIQ 2 (Creative): 11%
- PIQ 1, 3, 6, 7: 8-10% (lower - less emphasis on internal struggle)

---

#### 3. Specificity & Evidence (10%)
**From**: Both systems (PIQ: 12%, Extracurricular: 9%)
**What it measures**: Concrete details, numbers, sensory information that build credibility and vividness
**Why universal**: 100% of successful essays have high specificity
**Key criteria**:
- Quantified metrics and numbers (hours, people impacted, % improvement)
- Specific details vs vague statements
- Sensory information (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste)
- Proper nouns (names, places, organizations, titles)
- Time specificity (dates, durations, timelines)
- Before/after comparisons

**Prompt-specific weights**:
- PIQ 3 (Talent): 13% (highest - demonstrate skill mastery)
- PIQ 4 (Educational): 12%

**Key criteria**:
- Absence of essay-speak phrases ("I learned the value of...", "This experience taught me...")
- Natural conversational rhythm
- Active vs passive voice ratio (>70% active)
- Vocabulary authenticity (sounds like a 17-year-old, not a 40-year-old)

---

#### 5. Narrative Arc & Stakes (9%)
**From**: Both systems (PIQ: 15%, Extracurricular: 7%)
**What it measures**: Story structure with clear tension, conflict, turning points, and resolution that feels earned
**Why PIQ-specific**: PIQs are narratives, not bullet lists - story structure matters
**Key criteria**:
- Central tension and conflict clearly established
- Stakes clarity (what was at risk - reputation, relationship, identity, opportunity)

#### 6. Transformative Impact (10%)
**From**: Extracurricular system (was 10%)
**What it measures**: Genuine growth and change over time vs generic "learning experiences"
**Why critical**: UC wants to see development, not static achievements

---

## DIMENSIONS NOT INCLUDED (from original systems)

### From Existing 9-Dimension System:
- ❌ **Thematic Coherence** (3%) - Merged into Narrative Arc & Stakes

### From Extracurricular System:
- ❌ **Community & Collaboration** (8%) - Not universal enough for all PIQs
  - Rationale: PIQ 2 (Creative) and PIQ 5 (Challenge) often don't have community component
  - Solution: Capture this in Role Clarity & Ownership (showing impact on others when relevant)

- ❌ **Time Investment & Consistency** (6%) - Too specific to extracurriculars
  - Rationale: PIQ 5 (Challenge) might be a single event, not long-term
  - Solution: Capture dedication/depth within Specificity & Evidence

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Update `types.ts` with 13-dimension type definitions
2. ✅ Update `rubric.ts` with unified 13 dimensions + prompt-specific weights
3. ✅ Merge `issuePatterns.ts` from both systems (keep all 1,204 lines + add extracurricular patterns)
4. ✅ Merge `teachingExamples.ts` from both systems
5. ✅ Create `promptMetadata.ts` with 8 official UC PIQ texts
6. ✅ Create `dimensionWeights.ts` with prompt-specific weight configurations
7. ✅ Build analyzer that switches weights based on PIQ type
