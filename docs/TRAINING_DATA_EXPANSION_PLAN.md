# Training Data Expansion Plan: 120+ Exemplar UC PIQs

**Current Problem**: System trained on only 19 essays, heavily skewed toward extracurricular/activity narratives
**Goal**: Gather 15+ highest-quality exemplar essays for EACH of the 8 UC prompts (120+ total)
**Purpose**: Deep understanding of what excellent responses look like for each prompt type

---

## 📊 Current Training Data Gaps

### **What We Have** (19 essays):
- ✅ ~10-12 activity/leadership narratives (Harvard/UCLA/Berkeley admits)
- ✅ ~5-7 challenge/adversity essays
- ❌ Very few creative expression essays
- ❌ Very few talent/skill essays
- ❌ Very few educational journey essays
- ❌ Very few academic passion essays
- ❌ Very few community service essays (distinct from leadership)
- ❌ Almost no personal distinction essays

**Problem**: Our rubric will be biased toward activity-style narratives because that's what it's been trained on.

---

## 🎯 Target: 15 Exemplars Per Prompt × 8 Prompts = 120 Essays

### **Why 15 per prompt?**
1. **Diversity within prompt**: Different approaches, angles, topics
2. **Pattern recognition**: Need enough to identify consistent success patterns
3. **Edge case coverage**: Unconventional approaches that still work
4. **Quality range**: Mix of Tier 1 (Harvard) and Tier 2 (Top UC) to calibrate

### **Quality Criteria**:
- ✅ Confirmed admits to Harvard/Stanford/MIT/Yale/Princeton OR Top UCs (Berkeley/UCLA)
- ✅ Class of 2025-2029 (recent, current standards)
- ✅ Full 350-word PIQ text (not excerpts)
- ✅ Known prompt assignment (which of the 8 UC prompts)
- ✅ Diverse topics within each prompt

## 🎯 Analysis Plan for 120 Essays

Once we have 120 essays:

### **Phase 1: Pattern Identification by Prompt**
For each prompt, identify:
1. Common structural patterns (opening → body → closing)
2. Successful topic choices within prompt
3. Average dimension scores for Tier 1 vs Tier 2
4. Required vs optional elements
5. Red flags that led to rejection (if available)

### **Phase 2: Cross-Prompt Pattern Analysis**
1. Universal patterns across all prompts (vulnerability, specificity, etc.)
2. Prompt-specific patterns (leadership needs quantified impact, creative needs process)
3. Tier 1 differentiators (what separates Harvard from UC Berkeley?)
4. Dimension correlation (which dimensions predict overall success?)

### **Phase 3: Rubric Calibration**
1. Score all 120 essays with current rubric
2. Compare scores to actual admit outcomes
3. Adjust dimension weights if needed
4. Validate tier boundaries (90+ = Tier 1, etc.)
5. Update benchmarks per prompt

### **Phase 4: Training Data Integration**
1. Add exemplar patterns to prompt intelligence
2. Update adaptive rubric with prompt-specific insights

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### **Ethical Considerations**:
- Always anonymize essays (remove names, schools, identifying info)
- Get permission when possible
- Don't share essays publicly
- Use only for training/calibration, not distribution

### **Quality Control**:
- Verify admit status (not just "I got in" posts)
- Cross-reference with multiple sources
- Be skeptical of essays that seem too perfect
- Look for essays with minor flaws that still succeeded (more realistic)

### **Diversity Considerations**:
- Ensure representation across demographics
- Include first-gen, low-income, URM perspectives
- Include essays from various high school types (public, private, rural, urban)
- Include international student perspectives
