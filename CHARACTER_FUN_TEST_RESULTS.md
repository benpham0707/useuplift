## Test 1: General Help - Should Be Enthusiastic & Ask Discovery Questions

**Student Question**: "How can I make this better?"

**AI Coach Response**:
Okay, so I just read your draft and here's what jumped out at me: "At first only three people showed up to our beach cleanup"—this line? Keep it exactly as is. It's vulnerable, it's real, and it shows you started small. That's your strength.

Here's the thing though—right now you've got the skeleton of a great story, but it reads like bullet points on a resume. You wrote 49 words when you have 350 to work with. That's like telling a movie in tweets.

What I'm missing is the MOMENT. You say "I researched plastic pollution data"—but where were you when you found the statistic that made you go "holy crap, we need those water stations"? You presented to the school board—what did that room feel like? Were you nervous? Did someone challenge you?

Your voice is naturally direct and no-nonsense—"I founded," "They approved," "Now we have"—I love that rhythm. Don't lose it. But you need to zoom into ONE scene and let us see it happen.

Pick the moment right before you walked into that school board meeting. What were you holding? What were you thinking? Start there, then build to your numbers at the end.

You've got 300+ words to play with. Use them to show us the story behind "But I researched."

What was that research moment like?

## Test 2: Student Frustration - Should Be Empathetic & Make It Fun

**Student Question**: "I hate writing essays"

**AI Coach Response**:
I get it. Essays feel fake and awful, especially when you're naturally direct like you are.

But here's the thing—you wrote: "At first only three people showed up to our beach cleanup." That line? That's *good*. That's honest. That's the kind of writing that makes admissions officers actually pay attention instead of glazing over.

Your whole draft has this no-BS voice that I love. "I founded... I researched... They approved." Boom, boom, boom. Don't let anyone make you add flowery transitions or fancy vocabulary. That's not you.

Here's what's missing: You've got the skeleton of a great story, but I need to SEE that moment. You're at 49 words—you have 300+ words to play with. So let's use them.

Pick ONE moment to zoom into. Maybe it's standing on that beach with just three people, wondering if you made a mistake. Or walking into that school board meeting with your research. What were you actually thinking? What did the room look like? What did you say, exactly?

You don't need to become a different writer. You just need to let me into one real moment instead of giving me the highlight reel.

Which scene do you remember most clearly—the empty beach cleanup or the board presentation?

**✅ Character Analysis**:
- ❌ Uses playful language
- ✅ Shows enthusiasm (emphasis (*asterisks*), positive words, emphasis caps)
- ✅ Asks discovery questions
  - "Essays feel fake and awful, especially when you're naturally..."
  - "What were you actually thinking"
  - "What did you say, exactly"
- ✅ Has personality (not robotic)
- ✅ Makes it feel collaborative

## Test 3: Student Achievement - Should Celebrate with Enthusiasm

**Student Question**: "I just added more details about the board meeting!"

**AI Coach Response**:
Wait—I'm not seeing the board meeting details you mentioned! Your draft is still the original 49 words: "I founded our school's first Environmental Action Club. At first only three people showed up to our beach cleanup. But I researched plastic pollution data and presented to the school board. They approved funding for water refill stations. Now we have 45 members and reduced plastic waste by 47%."

Did the update not save? Because right now "presented to the school board" is still just four words—no scene, no details, no actual meeting.

Here's what I'm thinking happened: You know what you want to add (the board meeting specifics), but it's not on the page yet. And honestly? Good instinct. That's exactly where this essay needs to go deeper.

Your voice is perfect—short, punchy, no BS. "'At first only three people showed up to our beach cleanup'"—this line is gold. Keep this exact phrasing. It shows vulnerability without drama.

But that board presentation? That's your missing scene. I want to see you walking in there. What did the room look like? What was the first thing you said? Did anyone push back? 

You've got 301 words to work with—plenty of room to turn "presented to the school board" into an actual moment. Show me that meeting. What happened in that room that changed everything?

Want to try drafting that scene?

**✅ Character Analysis**:
- ✅ Uses playful language (gold)
- ✅ Shows enthusiasm (exclamation marks, positive words, emphasis caps)
- ✅ Asks discovery questions
  - "Now we have 45 members and reduced plastic waste by 47%."

## Test 4: Self-Discovery Question - Should Ask Probing Questions

**Student Question**: "What does this essay say about me?"

**AI Coach Response**:
Okay, so I just read this and here's what jumped out at me: You wrote 49 words that pack a serious punch. "At first only three people showed up to our beach cleanup"—keep this exactly as is. It's vulnerable and real, and it shows you're not afraid to start small.

Here's what your essay says about you right now: You're a problem-solver who doesn't just complain—you research, you present, you get results. The progression from 3 people to 45 members, from problem to 47% waste reduction—that's concrete impact. You're not the leader who gives speeches; you're the leader who shows up with data and makes things happen.

But here's what I'm not seeing yet: YOU in the moment. Right now this reads like a really solid resume bullet point. What was it like standing in front of the school board? Were you nervous? Did they push back? What did you say that convinced them?

You've got 301 words left—plenty of room to drop us into one specific scene. Pick the moment right before you presented to the board. Where were you? What were you thinking? That's your opening. Then keep everything else you've got—the data, the results, that perfect "three people showed up" line.

Want to dig into that presentation moment, or is there another scene that's bugging you about this draft?

**✅ Character Analysis**:
- ✅ Uses playful language (okay so/wait)
- ✅ Shows enthusiasm (positive words, emphasis caps)
- ✅ Asks discovery questions
  - "What was it like standing in front of the school board"
  - "What did you say that convinced them"
  - "What were you thinking"
  - "Then keep everything else you've got—the data, the results, ..."
- ✅ Has personality (not robotic)
- ✅ Makes it feel collaborative
