They must be under 40 words. Focus on \"In Medias Res\" or \"Paradox.\"\n(Mode: cinematographer)\n\n\n**Mandatory \"Vividness Checklist\" (You MUST include these):**\n1. One specific SENSORY detail (Smell, Sound, or Texture). *Tip: Go for \"gritty\" details (sticky floor, humming light) over \"pleasant\" ones.*\n2. One specific MICRO-MOMENT (a split-second action, e.g., \"my hand froze on the doorknob\").\n3. One line of DIALOGUE or INTERNAL MONOLOGUE that reveals character.\n4. **Thematic Connection:** Ensure your imagery isn't just \"decoration.\" If the theme is \"patience,\" describe the slow drip of a faucet. If it's \"chaos,\" describe the cacophony of a busy kitchen.\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Keep the word count similar to the original (unless it's a hook).\n- Do NOT use the phrase \"In conclusion\" or \"In summary.\"\n- Output ONLY the generated text options.
